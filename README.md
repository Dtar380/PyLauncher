### **An Open-Source Non-Premium MC Launcher**

PYLauncher is an Open-Source Non-Premium Minecraft launcher made thanks to
the [minecraft-launcher-lib](https://minecraft-launcher-lib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/getting_started.html).
PyLauncher doesn't have a GUI (yet) so it's not compiles

**The launcher has many functionalities, and those are:**

* Managing multiple users
* Managing multiple instances with:

 * Custom Routes
 * Custom Ram amount
* Playing custom versions and modpacks:

 * Built-in Forge
 * Built-in Fabric
 * Built-in Quilt
 * Support for external loaders
 * Support for .mrpack ModPacks

## :arrow_down: Installation

The installation process is simple:

1. Download python 3.12.1 and install
2. Download the repo
3. Run the `Installer.bat`

Now just by running the `Run.bat` file you'll be able to play Minecraft for Free!

This version also adds the ability to use custom Mod Loaders by installing them and then creating a installations with all ready installed versions and the ability to install Mod Packs via .mrpack files which can be downloaded from the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) page.

## Working On

Im on having predefined versions as well as fixing the [known issues](#-:open_file_folder:-Known-issues), but remember if you find another issue, you can report it to the team on the Issues page of the Github repo.

Further in the future im looking forward to implementing a GUI for a more user friendly app.
