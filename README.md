### **An Open-Source Non-Premium MC Launcher**

PYLauncher is an Open-Source Non-Premium Minecraft launcher made thanks to
the [minecraft-launcher-lib](https://minecraft-launcher-lib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/getting_started.html).
PyLauncher doesn't have a GUI (yet) so it's not compiles

**The launcher has many functionalities, and those are:**

* Managing multiple users
* Managing multiple instances with:
  * Custom Routes
  * Custom Ram ammount
* Predefined versions to play:
  * Latest Release
  * Latest Snapshot
* Playing custom versions and modpacks:
  * Built-in Forge
  * Built-in Fabric
  * Built-in Quilt
  * Support for external loaders

## :arrow_down: Instalation

The instalation proccess is simple:

1. Download python 3.12.1 and install
2. Download the repo
3. Run the `Installer.bat`

Now just by running the `Run.bat` file you'll be able to play Minecraft for Free!

## :loudspeaker: Anouncements

First release!!

Version 0.1 comes with no GUI but with many functionalities attached to it.

## Working On

Im working on a .mrpack importing system and using custom instalations as well as fixing the [known issues](#-:open_file_folder:-Known-issues), but remember if you find another issue, you can report it to the team on the Issues page of the Github repo.

Further in the future im looking forward to implementing a GUI for a more user friendly app.

## :vhs: Whatch the YT video (Spanish)

I will upload a video on the 31 of January on my channel about the PyLauncher proyect and a tutorial. But as Im native Spanish speaker and my channel content is full in Spanish I will not change for this video.

## :open_file_folder: Known issues

When creating an installation while being offline it gives an error. This happens because its appending the data base with all the versions on it. Im will solve it for the next version, but right now you need to be online to create new installations.
